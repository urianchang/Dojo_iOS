//: Assignment: Core Data II

In the previous tab, we were able to successfully connect to Core Data and perform a save.
What do you think would trigger the catch statement below?

do {
    try managedContext.save()
    print("Success!")
} catch {
    print("Error: \(error)")
}

Response:
An error occurs when trying to commit/save data.
